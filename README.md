Welcome to my **F1 Telemetry Analysis Tool**! This project analyzes Formula 1 telemetry data to compare driver performance, focusing on Max Verstappen (VER) and Lewis Hamilton (HAM) during a simulated 2023 qualifying session. Built for my F1 internship portfolio, this tool demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and performance optimization‚Äîkey areas for F1 engineering roles.

## üìä Project Overview

This tool uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to analyze F1 telemetry data, providing insights into driver performance through:

- **Speed Traces**: Compare Verstappen‚Äôs and Hamilton‚Äôs speeds across a lap.
- **Throttle Inputs**: Analyze throttle application to identify driving styles.
- **Time Delta**: Measure the time gap between drivers to pinpoint performance differences.

Due to missing telemetry data in the `fastf1` library for 2023 sessions, I generated simulated data to replicate a qualifying lap, ensuring the analysis pipeline is fully functional and ready for real data.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Data Processing**: Clean and align telemetry data for accurate comparisons.
- **Visualizations**: Generate plots for speed, throttle, and time delta using Matplotlib.
- **Insights**: Provide actionable recommendations for driver coaching and car setup.
- **Portfolio-Ready**: Includes PDF/HTML exports and a live demo on GitHub Pages.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

## üîç Key Insights

Based on the simulated data:

- **Speed Advantage**: Verstappen‚Äôs speed peaked at ~300 km/h on straights, compared to Hamilton‚Äôs ~290 km/h, suggesting a setup optimized for top speed.
- **Throttle Control**: Verstappen‚Äôs smoother throttle application (~80% vs. Hamilton‚Äôs 100%) in corners reduced wheelspin, saving ~0.1s per corner.
- **Time Delta**: Verstappen gained a consistent 0.2s lead in high-speed sections, highlighting setup differences.
- **Applications**:
  - **Driver Coaching**: Advise Hamilton to adopt smoother throttle inputs in corners.
  - **Car Setup**: Recommend Mercedes adjust for better straight-line speed.
  - **Strategy**: Optimize Red Bull‚Äôs setup for high-speed tracks like Silverstone.
